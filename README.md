# Health_Lifestyle_Data_Analysis
## Objective
A synthetic health and lifestyle dataset was analyzed using Python. The project includes the following; exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and a classification model to predict the presence of chronic disease based on lifestyle factors.
## Acquired Skills
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data visualization
- Feature engineering
- Classification modeling with Random Forest
- Model evaluation and interpretation
- Working with Jupyter Notebooks in a reproducible format
## Tools Utilized (Python Libraries)
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
## Procedures
1. **Load and inspect the dataset**  
   Understand the structure, identify missing values, and explore column types.

3. **Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)**  
   Visualize key patterns in age, BMI, sleep hours, and other health indicators.

4. **Feature engineering**  
   - Create a BMI category feature  
   - Calculate a simple lifestyle risk score from smoking, alcohol, and exercise

5. **Preprocess data**  
   - Encode categorical variables  
   - Handle missing values using median/mode imputation

6. **Train a classification model**  
   Use a Random Forest Classifier to predict the presence of chronic disease.

7. **Evaluate model performance**  
   Analyze confusion matrix, precision, recall, and feature importance.

8. **Visual summary**  
   Include key plots such as lifestyle score vs. disease presence.
